Consensus among doctors is that a fair policy should prioritize patients whose conditions would deteriorate most quickly without a transplant. Current practice prioritizes patients who are most likely to die or become medically unfit for transplant within 3 months. Sam Gilmour, Josh Wilde, and I used machine learning and optimization to explore candidate ranking policies based on projected post-transplant outcomes rather than pre-transplant vitality.\nDeliverables\n  Poster   Final report   6.867 Machine Learning Fall 2019\nA policy based on post-transplant outcomes necessarily accounts for organ features as well as patient features. We formulated a maximum weighted matching model in the lineage of work by Bertsimas et al. The weights were equal to the gain that the transplant system would receive by matching an organ to a particular patient, quantified by organ acceptance likelihood and projected post-transplant survival. We further constrained the model by including demographic fairness considerations. We constructed a Lagrangean relaxation of the fairness constraints to obtain fairness-adjusted weights in a classical matching problem.\nWe required a method for which system benefits could be estimated for newly observed patient-organ pairs. We obtained these estimated benefits as the solutions to a standard OLS regression problem, in which patient and organ features predicted fairness-adjusted weights to the above matching problem.\nWe iterated with a dynamic policy that changes according to the patients on the waitlist. We hypothesized that \u0016the fairness-adjusted weights depend on the characteristics of the current patient waitlist and the organs available for transplant. Our strategy was to predict this dependence by regressing over batch-level organ and patient features to predict one fairness-adjusted weight in the static priority map. Collectively, the learned parameters formed a dynamic policy map generator that yielded fairness-adjusted weights for a given batch of patients and organs.\nWe built a model that simulates liver allocation and survival outcomes to benchmark the performance of our policies against existing ranking policies. Simulations showed that our policies resulted in approximately 1% more transplants and consequently 1% fewer pre-transplant deaths, with minimal effect on post-transplant morbidity and with continued fair allocation for targeted demographics. Furthermore, our dynamic policy performed at par with the static policy, indicating that its additional computational overhead may be unnecessary.\n","date":1609368212,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609368212,"objectID":"cee591bd16c46fc3beb691127e058ae8","permalink":"https://kscummings.github.io/project/livers/","publishdate":"2020-12-30T17:43:32-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/livers/","section":"project","summary":"Deep learning and optimization to rank wait-listed liver transplant candidates.","tags":["healthcare","deep learning","machine learning","optimization","simulation"],"title":"You Liver and You Learn","type":"project"},{"authors":["Kayla Cummings","Vikrant Vaze","Özlem Ergun","Cynthia Barnhart"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609176453,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609176453,"objectID":"43a8a2d0285ac941ad7be3edbea60c78","permalink":"https://kscummings.github.io/publication/alliance/","publishdate":"2020-12-28T12:27:33-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/alliance/","section":"publication","summary":"We characterize the integrated pricing of first/last mile transportation systems as a cooperative game.

This work addresses how the government can ensure the cost-effective procurement of pediatric vaccines by all U.S. children from private manufacturers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) significant patronage of pediatric vaccines affords them leverage in negotiating public-sector prices that prevent the formation of monopolies, but existing vaccine pricing literature excludes the CDC as a rational player. **Academic/practical relevance**: We combine optimization and game theoretic techniques to address cost-effective immunization of all U.S. children. **Methodology**: Our optimization model from the CDC’s perspective minimizes negotiated government costs while ensuring adequate national vaccination levels, linking dynamics in public and private sectors, and incorporating competitive manufacturer behavior. The optimization model embeds an extant game theoretic price model to capture competitive interactions among manufacturers in the private sector, where they compete independently of the CDC. The model is validated in an extended case study of the Infanrix–Daptacel vaccine duopoly. **Results**: The study indicates that dissimilar products advantageously segment markets with asymmetric manufacturers. Furthermore, markets are at lower risk when high capacity manufacturers have moderate target profits, especially in cases of high demand and asymmetry. We demonstrate that our model can help restabilize a market that experiences a vaccine shortage and that the CDC might mitigate the same shortage using strategies that depend on which manufacturer is limited. We also underline scenarios in which the CDC may be able to prevent monopolies through financial incentives to manufacturers. The results support a paradigm shift from annual contracts to ongoing negotiations, which would enable the CDC to exercise control over high-risk markets. **Managerial implications**: Our study demonstrates an analytical approach for managerial government officials to influence pediatric vaccine prices via the procurement of public-sector goods.

The first stage is a facility location problem, and the second stage is a stock pre-positioning problem that depends on the selected facility locations.\nJosh and I augmented this work using robust optimization, whose theory seeks decisions that successfully navigate the trade-off between expected optimality and mitigation of parametric uncertainty. Emergency humanitarian demand can wildly oscillate between negligible and astronomical levels from year to year, distinguishing humanitarian network design from the typical facility location problem. Because historical demand is consequentially not a reliable indication of future demand, we capture emergency demand uncertainty using machine learning demand forecasts. We build a robust optimization formulation by embedding these forecasts into uncertainty sets for the emergency demand parameters.\nWe find that optimal facility locations are agnostic to emergency demand uncertainty, which lends confidence to this more permanent first-stage decision. Fulfillment costs meaningfully decrease as a result of the incorporation of demand forecasts into uncertainty sets, but inventory allocations are highly paranoid and sensitive to the specific demand forecast. This conclusion together with the invariant optimal network configuration indicates that the robust demand pre-positioning problem can be divorced from the facility location problem.\n","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"928b922245e4be502401b6e9e3cb5503","permalink":"https://kscummings.github.io/project/unhcr/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/unhcr/","section":"project","summary":"Emergency demand predictions inform robust humanitarian network design.","tags":["robust optimization","machine learning","optimization"],"title":"Are you sure that goes there?","type":"project"},{"authors":["Kayla Cummings","Janie Neal","Andi Chen","Tzu-Yi Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1543774251,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543774251,"objectID":"daf763c1b19e0d683047218b3a23652b","permalink":"https://kscummings.github.io/publication/blackstart/","publishdate":"2020-01-25T13:10:51-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/blackstart/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["networks"],"title":"An Exploration of the Network Installation and Recovery Problem with Blackstart Nodes","type":"publication"}]
